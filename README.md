## OVERVIEW:
  The purpose of this Analysis is to get W.Avey who is famous for his surfing, to believe and invest in my dream of having a Surf N' Shake Shop on the beautiful island of Oahu. Due to a past failed investment early in his career, W. Avey is a little reluctant to invest. I needed to win him over by analysing some weather data that he has from Oahu.
  
  ## JUNE RESULTS:
  * The Max temperature in Oahu for the month of June is 85 degrees. Which is great weather for surfing and enjoying ice cream.
  * The lowest temperature in Oahu for the month of June is 64 degrees. Which is not ideal for surfing or eating ice cream but it is also not the worst temperature to enjoy           surfing and or ice cream.
  * As you can see from the 2 charts below that June's average temperature throughout the month is pretty steady and remains in the high 70's which is nice comfortable weather.

## DECEMBER RESULTS:
* The Max temperature in Oahu for the month of December is 83 degrees. Which is also great weather for surfing and enjoying ice cream.
* The average temperature for Oahu in the month of december is in the low 70's at 71 degrees.
* The lowest temperature in Oahu for the month of December is 56 degrees. Temperature as low as 56 is pretty cold for surfing. It is also important to show that in the charts below that 69 degree temperature are only 25%. Temperatures lower than 68 degrees will have a lower percentage.

## SUMMARY:
  The Analyzed weather data of both June and December proves that the temperatures on the beautiful island of Oahuis perfect for the Surf N' Shake shop. The low temperatures in december where surfing would be less desireableare very minimal and should not affect the sucess of the shop.
### Additional Queries
* I would like to perform an analysis on how much rain the island gets and which months are considered the rainy season. Performing this analysis 
  would be great for tourist and sufers in general.
* The second query/analysis that I would like to perform would be which months are the busiest on the island. Which months does Oahu see the most tourist. This analysis would be     perfect to project revenue and the change in cost that may arise as well as having to possibly rev up staffing.
